Input features

Feature         Planes
----------------------
P1 pieces       2 (normal and king)
P2 pieces       2
Color           1 (color of player to make a move)

T = 8 step history for the all features.

8 x 4 x (8 x 2 + 8 x 2 + 8 x 1) = 32 x 24 = 768


Double jumps are handled by offering the player another move after a jump. They
may jump again or pass if no jump is available. This means we need player color
in the history.

N.B. "If a man jumps into the kings row, the current move terminates; the piece
is crowned as a king but cannot jump back out as in a multi-jump, until the
next move."


Output features

Feature         Planes
----------------------
Move direction  4
Pass            1

8 x 4 x (4 + 1) = 32 x 5 = 160

Move direction may be set for each source square. Jumps occur automatically in
that direction.

Pass skips the turn without moving. This is only valid after a jump if no
double-jump is available.
